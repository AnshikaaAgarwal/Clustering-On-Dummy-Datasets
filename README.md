This repository contains:
Basics of Clustering
Implementation Of  2 popular Clustering Algorithms namely K-means Clustering Algorithm and DBSCAN Algorithm on Dummy Datasets.
K-Means uses the concept of centroids and Distances to group similar data whereas DBSCAN is responsible for doing density-based Clustering.
Furthermore, Implementation of K-means algorithm on images in order to perform Image Segmentation is also done.
Image Compression using k-Means.
Reference Research Papers and Dummy Datasets used.
