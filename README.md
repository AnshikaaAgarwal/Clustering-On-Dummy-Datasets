# Clustering Algorithms and Image Processing


This repository contains:

### Basics of Clustering

* Implementation of 2 popular Clustering Algorithms:
	* K-means Clustering Algorithm
	* DBSCAN Algorithm
	on Dummy Datasets.

### How the Algorithms Work

* **K-Means**: uses the concept of centroids and Distances to group similar data
* **DBSCAN**: is responsible for doing density-based Clustering

### Image Processing Applications

* Implementation of K-means algorithm on images in order to perform **Image Segmentation**
* **Image Compression** using k-Means

### Resources

* [Reference Research Papers](#)
* [Dummy Datasets](#)
* [Images](#)
